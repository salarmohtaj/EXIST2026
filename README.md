# EXIST 2026

This repository contains the project materials, codebase, and experiments developed for the **EXIST 2026 shared task**, focusing on applied NLP and machine learning methods for classification and evaluation of text-based data.

The project is designed to be modular, reproducible, and easy to extend for experimenting with different model architectures and training strategies.

---

## 📌 Overview

The main objective of this project is to build robust NLP models for the EXIST 2026 task, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Evaluation using standard classification metrics
- Experiment tracking and result analysis

The repository supports both traditional machine learning baselines and transformer-based models.
